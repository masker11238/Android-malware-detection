Paper: Android Malware Detection Based on Sensitive Features Combination
The code of extracting features from APK files, processing features and generating input for machine learning is recorded. The classification algorithm used in machine learning adopts algorithms in software Weka3.8.
"decompile": Decompile APK files.
"extration"：The inclusion of "extration" in the file name means that four features are extracted from the file.
"cre": The inclusion of "cre" in the file name means that generating vectors for machine learning input. 0 indicates that the feature does not exist in the software, and 1 indicates that the feature appears in the software.
"num": The inclusion of "num" in the file name means that generating vectors for machine learning input.The value indicates the number of times the feature appears in the software.
"sorted": Rank the frequency of all features in malware or benign software.
"diff"：Obtain features with large frequency difference between malware and benign software.
"only": Features that appears only in malware and never in benign software.
